# Electricity Usage Trend

This is a preliminary analysis for the data published by the Australian government from "the customer trial conducted as part of the Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) project (2010-2014)" [more about the trial here.](https://data.gov.au/dataset/smart-grid-smart-city-customer-trial-data)

The analysis aims to discover the customers usage trends and cluster them accordingly. This would also help the utilities to have deeper understanding of the behavior of individuals and develop their marketing strategies accordingly. 

This data set imposes limitations due to the few number of customers included. However, it shows what could be done with a bigger data set.

Further enhancements are to be added.
